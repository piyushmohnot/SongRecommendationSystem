# SongRecommendationSystem
1. The objective was to predict the popularity of any song and build a recommendation system to recommend songs. (Spotify data was used from kaggle)
2. To start with, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA to derive insights from the data using visualisations, graphs by creating certain KPIs. Readings were as follows:
-> more than 1500+ popular songs are identified and added every year in Spotify
-> most popular Artist from year 1921 to 2020 were the Beatles
-> most popular song is Dakiti by Bad Bunny & Jhay Cortez’s
-> the data was further split into — train and test datasets in 80-20 ratio for model building and evaluation respectively
3. Using GridSearchCV we could find the optimal hyperparameters for the decision tree Regressor model and achieved an accuracy of 76.6%
